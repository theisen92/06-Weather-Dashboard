## Usage

Able to search for cities and get the current and 5 day forecast

## Credits

I primarily used the information from class activities and MDN Developer for resources. Used the https://openweathermap.org/api for the weather api, used bootstrap for design and moment JS to reformat the dates and time. Then Also looked up some examples of ajax on full stack.

## Contributing

I worked on the project with on of my classmates to bounce some ideas off each-other

## Challenges

The main challenge that I was running into during this project the layout and adding the functionality of the previous search buttons.
I was able to figure out the layout using bootstrap grid. Then the previous search buttons started working when started to put classes in the new buttons created.
But I wasn't able to figure out how to have the city input not submit when blank even though I put an if null statement. I'll keep looking into it and see if I can get that bug fixed.
